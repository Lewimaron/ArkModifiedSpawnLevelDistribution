# ARK Beyond API: Modified Spawn Level Distribution (Plugin)

## Introduction

Changes to spawn level distribution on The Island and Scorched Earth to match the official spawn level distribution on Ragnarok and The Center.

## Installation

* Install ARK Beyond API (forked by me) on your server.
* Copy/extract plugin to `BeyondApi/Plugins/ArkModifiedSpawnLevelDistribution`.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin is based on Michidu's work on Ark-Server-Plugins and ARK Beyond API. The basic plumbing code is copied directly from those plugins.
